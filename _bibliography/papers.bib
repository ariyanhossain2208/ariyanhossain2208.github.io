  abstract      = {News headlines or titles that deliberately persuade readers to view a particular online content are referred to as clickbait. There have been numerous studies focused on clickbait detection in English language, compared to that, there have been very few researches carried out that address clickbait detection in Bangla news headlines. In this study, we have experimented with several distinctive transformers models, namely BanglaBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. Additionally, we introduced a domain-adaptive pretrained model, BanglaClickBERT. We conducted a series of experiments to identify the most effective model. The dataset we used for this study contained 15,056 labeled and 65,406 unlabeled news headlines; in addition to that, we have collected more unlabeled Bangla news headlines by scraping clickbait-dense websites making a total of 1 million unlabeled news headlines in order to make our BanglaClickBERT. Our approach has successfully surpassed the performance of existing state-of-the-art technologies providing a more accurate and efficient solution for detecting clickbait in Bangla news headlines, with potential implications for improving online content quality and user experience.},

  abstract      = {As large language models, or LLMs, continue to advance in recent years, they require the development of a potent system to detect whether a text was created by a human or an LLM in order to prevent the unethical use of LLMs. To address this challenge, ALTA Shared Task 2023 introduced a task to build an automatic detection system that can discriminate between human-authored and synthetic text generated by LLMs. In this paper, we present our participation in this task where we proposed a feature-level ensemble of two transformer models namely DeBERTaV3 and XLM-RoBERTa to come up with a robust system. The given dataset consisted of textual data with two labels where the task was binary classification. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieved competitive performance among the participants. We believe this solution would make an impact and provide a feasible solution for detection of synthetic text detection. },
