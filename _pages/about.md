I am a Computer Science & Engineering Graduate student at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/) with an interest in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Programming Languages.

I am a proficient programmer with expertise in a range of languages, including Python, Java, C++, and more. 

I have hands-on experience in developing and implementing machine learning algorithms, as well as working with neural networks and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. 

My strong foundation in Natural Language Processing has enabled me to create NLP-based projects. As a research enthusiast, I am deeply passionate about advancing the field and my contributions have made a meaningful impact in this area.
